# My Tasks
It's a to-do-list console application.

## How it works
When you open the program, you'll get a menu of options. Each option or shortcut has a specific function. Enter the option or shortcut name in the console to take an action. Here's a list of valid options or shortcuts that you can use:
- `list`: to list all tasks.

- `add`: to add a new task to the list.

- `remove`: to remove a task from the list.

- `help`: to display a list of valid shortcuts.

- `exit`: to exit the menu.

## The project structure
- `/.vscode/`: this is for the configuration files of vscode editor on windows.

- `/bin/`: this is for the project binary files or executable files.

- `/include/`: this is for the project header files.

- `/src/`: this is for the project source files.

## Environment where tested
- `IDE`: Visual Studio Code.

- `Compiler`: g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0

- `Operating system`: Windows 10, 64-bit.
